# Development Notes

## Setting up CMAKE (without VS)

### Requirements

* CMake
* Python3 Pip
  * Requires `Python3`
  * Ensure installed scripts directory for Pip (`/home/<name>/.local/bin`) is on the PATH:
* cmake-converter
  * Installed using Pip.
  * `pip install cmake-converter`

### Steps

Simply run `./bin/cmake.sh` - this will build the CMAKE files from `GridFight/GridFight.sln`, and then run CMAKE on the project.
